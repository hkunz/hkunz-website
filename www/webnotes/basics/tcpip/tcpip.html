<h2>TCP/IP Tutorial</h2>
<p><b>*TCP/IP is the communication protocol for the Internet.<br /></b>
<b>*In this tutorial you will learn what TCP/IP is, and how it works.</b></p><hr />

<h3 class="tutheader">TCP/IP is the Internet Communication Protocol</h3>
<p>A communication protocol is a description of the rules computers 
must follow to communicate with each other. The Internet communication protocol 
defines the rules for computer communication over the Internet.</p>

<h3 class="tutheader">Your Browser and Your Server Use TCP/IP</h3>
<p>Internet browsers and Internet servers use TCP/IP to connect to the Internet. 
Your browser uses TCP/IP to access Internet servers, and servers use TCP/IP to 
send HTML back to your browser.</p>

<h3 class="tutheader">Your E-Mail Uses TCP/IP</h3>

<p>Your e-mail program uses TCP/IP to connect to the Internet for sending and receiving e-mails.</p>

<h3 class="tutheader">Your Internet Address is TCP/IP</h3>
<p>Your Internet address "222.127.49.19" is a part of the standard TCP/IP protocol. 
(And so is your domain name "www.someonesplace.com")</p>

<h2>Introduction to TCP/IP</h2>
<p class="intro">TCP/IP is the communication protocol for the Internet.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Computer Communication Protocol</h3>
<p>A computer communication protocol is a description of the rules computers 
must follow to communicate with each other.</p>

<h3>What is TCP/IP?</h3>
<p>TCP/IP is the communication protocol for 
communication between computers connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>TCP/IP stands for <b>T</b>ransmission <b>C</b>ontrol <b>P</b>rotocol / <b>I</b>nternet

<b>P</b>rotocol.</p>
<p>The standard defines how electronic devices (like computers) should be 
connected to the Internet, and how data should be transmitted between them.</p>

<h3>Inside TCP/IP</h3>

<p>Hiding inside the TCP/IP standard there are a number of protocols for handling 
data communication:</p>

<ul>
	<li>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) communication between applications</li>

	<li>UDP (User Datagram Protocol) simple communication between applications</li>
	<li>IP (Internet Protocol) communication between computers</li>
	<li>ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for errors and statistics</li>
	<li>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for dynamic addressing</li>
</ul>

<p>You will learn more about these standards later in this tutorial.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>TCP Uses a Fixed Connection</h2>
<p>TCP is for communication between applications.</p>
<p>When an application wants to communicate with another application via TCP, it 
sends a communication request. This request must be sent to an exact  
address. After a "handshake" between the two applications, TCP will setup a 
"full-duplex" communication between the two applications.</p>
<p>The "full-duplex" communication will occupy the communication line between 
the two computers until it is closed by one of the two applications.</p>
<p>UDP is very similar to TCP, but is simpler and less reliable.</p>

<h3>IP is Connection-Less</h3>
<p>IP is for communication between computers.</p>

<p>IP is a "connection-less" communication protocol. It does not occupy the 
communication line between two communicating computers. This way IP reduces the 
need for network lines. Each line can be used for communication between many 
different computers at the same time.</p>
<p>With IP, messages (or other data) are broken up into small independent 
"packets" and sent between computers via the Internet.</p>
<p>IP is responsible for "routing" each packet to its destination. </p>

<h3>IP Routers</h3>
<p>When an IP packet is sent from a computer, it arrives at an IP router.</p>
<p>The IP router is responsible for "routing" the packet to its destination, 
directly or via another router. </p>
<p>The path the packet will follow might be different from other packets of the 
same communication. The router is responsible for the right addressing depending 
on traffic volume, errors in the network, or other parameters.</p>

<h3>Connection-Less Analogy</h3>
<p>Communicating via  IP is like sending a long letter as a large number of 
small postcards, each finding its own (often different) way to the receiver.</p>

<h3>TCP/IP</h3>
<p>TCP/IP is TCP and IP working together.</p>
<p>TCP takes care of the communication between your application software (i.e. 
your browser) and your network software.</p>
<p>IP takes care of the communication with other computers.</p>
<p>TCP is responsible for breaking data down into IP packets before they are 
sent, and for assembling the packets when they arrive.</p>

<p>IP is responsible for sending the packets to the receiver.</p>
<hr />

<h2>TCP/IP Addressing</h2>

<p class="intro">TCP/IP uses 32 bits, or 4 numbers between 0 and 255 to address a 
computer.</p><hr />

<h3>IP Addresses</h3>
<p>Each computer must have an IP address before it can connect to the Internet.</p>

<p>Each IP packet must have an address before it can be sent to another 
computer.</p>
<p>This is an IP address: 192.68.20.50.<br/>
This might be the same IP address:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a> </p>
<p>You will learn more about IP addresses and IP names in the next chapter of 
this tutorial.</p>

<h3>An IP Address Contains 4 Numbers.</h3>

<p>This is your  IP address: <b>222.127.49.19</b></p>

<p>TCP/IP uses 4 numbers to address a computer. Each computer must have a unique 
4 number address.</p>

<p>The numbers are always between 0 and 255. Addresses are normally written as four 
numbers separated by a period like this: <b>192.168.1.50</b>.</p>

<h3>32 Bits = 4 Bytes</h3>
<p>TCP/IP uses 32 bits addressing. One computer byte is 8 bits. So TCP/IP uses 4 
computer bytes.</p>
<p>A computer byte can contain 256 different values:</p>
<p>00000000, 00000001, 00000010, 00000011, 00000100, 00000101, 00000110, 
00000111, 00001000 .......and all the way up to 11111111.</p>
<p>Now you know why a TCP/IP address is 4 numbers between 0 and 255 </p>

<h3>Domain Names</h3>

<p>12 digit numbers are hard to remember. Using a name is easier.</p>
<p>Names used for TCP/IP addresses are called domain names. w3schools.com is a 
domain name. </p>
<p>When you address a web site like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">
http://www.w3schools.com</a>, the name is translated to a number by a DNS 
process (Domain Name Server).</p>
<p>All over the world, a large number of DNS servers are connected to the 
Internet. DNS servers are responsible for translating domain names into TCP/IP 
addresses and update each other with new domain names.</p>
<p>When a new domain name is registered together with a TCP/IP address, DNS 
servers all over the world are updated with this information.</p><hr />

<h2>TCP/IP Protocols</h2>
<p class="intro">TCP/IP is a large collection of different communication protocols.</p>
<hr />

<h3>A Family of Protocols</h3>
<p>TCP/IP is a large collection of different communication protocols based upon 
the two original protocols TCP and IP.</p><hr />

<h4>TCP - Transmission Control Protocol</h4>
<p>TCP is used for transmission of data from an application to 
the network.</p>
<p>TCP is responsible for breaking data down into IP packets before they are 
sent, and for assembling the packets when they arrive.</p><hr />

<h4>IP - Internet Protocol</h4>
<p>IP takes care of the communication with other computers.</p>
<p>IP is responsible for the sending and receiving data packets over the 
Internet.</p><hr />

<h4>HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</h4>
<p>HTTP takes care of the communication between a web server and a 
web browser.</p>
<p>HTTP is used for sending requests from a web client (a browser) 
to a web server, returning web content (web pages) from the server back to the 
client.</p><hr />

<h4>HTTPS - Secure HTTP</h4>
<p>HTTPS takes care of secure communication between a web server 
and a web browser.</p>
<p>HTTPS typically handles credit card transactions and other 
sensitive data.</p><hr />

<h4>SSL - Secure Sockets Layer</h4>
<p>The SSL protocol is used for encryption of data for secure data transmission.</p><hr />

<h4>SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</h4>
<p>SMTP is used for transmission of e-mails.</p><hr />

<h4>MIME - Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions</h4>
<p>The MIME protocol lets SMTP transmit multimedia files including voice, audio, 
and binary data across TCP/IP networks.</p><hr />

<h4>IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol</h4>
<p>IMAP is used for storing and retrieving e-mails.</p><hr />

<h4>POP - Post Office Protocol</h4>
<p>POP is used for downloading e-mails from an e-mail server to a 
personal computer.</p><hr />

<h4>FTP - File Transfer Protocol</h4>
<p>FTP takes care of transmission of files between computers.</p><hr />

<h4>NTP - Network Time Protocol</h4>
<p>NTP is used to synchronize the time (the clock) between 
computers.</p><hr />

<h4>DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h4>
<p>DHCP is used for allocation of dynamic IP addresses to computers 
in a network.</p><hr />

<h4>SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol</h4>
<p>SNMP is used for administration of computer networks.</p><hr />

<h4>LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</h4>
<p>LDAP is used for collecting information about users and e-mail 
addresses from the internet.</p><hr />

<h4>ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol</h4>
<p>ICMP takes care of error handling in the network.</p><hr />

<h4>ARP - Address Resolution Protocol</h4>
<p>ARP is used by IP to find the hardware address of a computer 
network card based on the IP address.</p><hr />

<h4>RARP - Reverse Address Resolution Protocol</h4>
<p>RARP is used by IP to find the IP address based on the hardware 
address of a computer network card.</p><hr />

<h4>BOOTP - Boot Protocol</h4>
<p>BOOTP is used for booting (starting) computers from the network.</p><hr />

<h4>PPTP - Point to Point Tunneling Protocol</h4>
<p>PPTP is used for setting up a connection (tunnel) between 
private networks.</p><hr />

<h2>TCP/IP Email</h2>
Email is one of the most important uses of TCP/IP.<hr />

<h3>You Don't  </h3>
<p>When you write an email, you don't use TCP/IP.</p>
<p>When you write an email, you use an email program like Lotus Notes, Microsoft 
Outlook or Netscape Communicator.</p>

<h3>Your Email Program Does</h3>
<p>Your email program uses different TCP/IP protocols:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It sends your emails using SMTP</li>

	<li>It can download your emails from an email server using POP</li>
	<li>It can connect to an email server using IMAP</li>
</ul>

<h3>SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>The SMTP protocol is used for the transmission of e-mails. SMTP takes care of 
sending your email to another computer.</p>
<p>Normally your email is sent to an email server (SMTP server), and then to 
another server or servers, and finally to its destination.</p>
<p>SMTP can only transmit pure text. It cannot transmit binary data like pictures, sounds or 
movies.</p>
<p>SMTP uses the MIME protocol to send binary data across TCP/IP networks. The 
MIME protocol converts binary data to pure text.</p>

<h3>POP - Post Office Protocol</h3>
<p>The POP protocol is used by email programs (like Microsoft Outlook) to 
retrieve emails from an email server.</p>
<p>If your email program uses POP, all your emails are downloaded to your email 
program (also called email client), each time it connects to your email server.</p>

<h3>IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol</h3>
<p>The IMAP protocol is used by email programs (like Microsoft Outlook) just 
like the POP protocol.</p>
<p>The main difference between the IMAP protocol and the POP protocol is that 
the IMAP protocol will not automatically download all your emails each time your 
email program connects to your email server.</p>
<p>The IMAP protocol allows you to see through your email messages at the email 
server before you download them. With IMAP you can choose to download your 
messages or just delete them. This way IMAP is perfect if you need to connect to 
your email server from different locations, but only want to download your 
messages when you are back in your office.</p><hr />
